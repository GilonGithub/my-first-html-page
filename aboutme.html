            <p>Various case studies to explain the context, for instance... One of the best case study mention in the book is story about a business person who got bankrupt and he had to leave his house with all things in it. So when they were leaving the house and doing the handover legal formality with the bank representatives the husband insisted of sending kids a day before this to some relative but the wife insisted letting the kids watch the whole process as she argued that she wants their kids to see this fall of his father's empire because she wants her kids to see their father coming back from this downfall & learn important lesson and they did saw him coming back to the same financial status in few years. They did learn from this and used this learning when they started their own career. Amazing case study</p>
